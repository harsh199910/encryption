# encryption

/******************************************************************************

Welcome to encryption algorithm 

this code is in c++14 format . input value are message and key.regarding complexity,
it use more complex algorithm than 3DEA(Triple Data Encryption Algorithm) .
orgin is based on CAESER CIPHER .turing 56 bit key into 112 bit complexity


INPUT---message
        key(should be same in decryption)

             HAPPY CODING

*******************************************************************************/

hey people welcome to encryption (ver 1.0.0),i request all the github user to help me for the evalution of my new encryption algorithm .

(this codeing is done in C++14)
HAPPY CODING 

ANY REVIEW OR IDEA MAIL ME ON
